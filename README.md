# Tower-Defense

This is a small project I worked on in my free time over my freshman year of university.
It is inspired by the mechanics of Dungeon Defenders' Summoner character and Kingdom Rush's upgrade system
It features
- procedurally generated maps
- tower upgrade trees
- repositionable towers (still a WIP)
